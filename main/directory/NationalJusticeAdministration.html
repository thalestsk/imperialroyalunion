                    <p>The National Justice Administration is the legal arm of HIM Government. It is responsible for the prosecution of all criminal offences across the nation in the courts and for the provision of legal advice for the government on matters of international, civil and constitutional law. While other departments under HIM Government may have their own specialised legal team, the Administration renders assistance in setting up such legal teams. Territorial Administrative Authorities and Cantonal Governments have their own independent legal counsels to prevent a conflict of interest when HIM Government is required to pursue legal action against the local authorities.</p></div>
