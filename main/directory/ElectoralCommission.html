                    <h3>Voting Secrecy</h3>
                    <p>Each vote cast is cast in secret. The Commission will post independent observers at polling stations and counting stations during each election to ensure strict adherence to ballot secrecy. While serial numbers may be attached to ballot papers, counting officers responsible for the opening and counting of ballots do not have access to elector rolls and are unable to identify a particular ballot to any voter or polling station.</p>
                    <h3>Political Donations</h3>
                    <p>Political donations must be declared to the Commission within 24 hours of the recipt of such donations. Donations by private individuals may not exceed IRE 20,000 per donor, and donations by organisations and business entities may not exceed IRE 1,000,000 per donor. The Commission reserves the right to confiscate donations exceeding such amounts and those suspected to originate from unlawful activity.</p>
                    <h3>Mandatory Voting</h3>
                    <p>The statutory voting age differs within each Territory. Voters may check their voting eligibility on their Unipass account. Voting is mandatory - voters will be struck off the corresponding elector roll for failing to vote during an election in which they are eligible to do so. A fee of IRE 100 is charged by the Commission to reinstate voters onto the elector rolls.</p>
                    <h3>Boundaries of Electoral Divisions</h3>
                    <p>All changes to boundaries of electoral divisions by the Territorial Adminitrative Authorities (and Cantonal Governments if the authority to modify such boundaries has been delegated to) must be reviewed, vetted, and certified by the Commission no later than 6 months before the elections. Changes made after the deadline will only take effect after the election has concluded. The Commission reserves the right to deny or refuse changes should it deem the changes unnecessary or unreasonable.</p>
