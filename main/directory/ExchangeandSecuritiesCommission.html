            <h2>About Us</h2><hr>
            <h3>Three Exchanges System</h3>
            <p>Imperial Royal Union's exchange eco-system comprises of 3 main exchange operators - the Port Imperial Exchange (PIPEX), the Sydonis Stock Exchange (SYDSE), and the Beruma Mercantile Exchange (BERMEX). Located in the 3 timezones across the nation, the PIPEX opens earlier from 8.00 AM to 4.00 PM Western Imperialean Time (UTC+8); the SYDSE opens from 9.00 AM to 5.00 PM Central Imperialean Time (UTC+9); and the BERMEX opens from 10.00 AM to 6.00 PM Eastern Imperialean Time (UTC+10). Together the national financial markets are open for an extended duration of 12 trading hours. </p>
            <p>In addition, both the SYDSE and BERMEX are subject to further regulations by their respective Cantonal Governments in which they are domicile. This means that there are 3 unique sets of trading rules which affect the liquidity, volatility, spread, efficiency, and the overall stability of the markets. As a result of this arrangement, there are significant arbitrage opportunities between the exchange markets.</p>
            <p>The PIPEX, the SYDSE, and the BERMEX are operated independently of each other by different companies, although the common shareholder is HIM Government who owns 25% of each exchange through the sovereign wealth fund Albatross Group Holding's subsidiary, Albatross Financial Holdings. Institutional investors and private accredited investors are prohibited from holding more than 1% in shares of more than 1 exchange, unless the holdings are held in exchange-traded funds.</p>
