                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Imperial Royal Union is an absolute monarchy - the Emperor is the highest authority of the nation and in order to govern effectively, His Imperial Majesty's Government ("HIM Government") must be properly empowered and structured to assist the Emperor. The political system in Imperial Royal Union is a mixed-system and is tiered. The Emperor, through HIM Government, is responsible for the collective defence, security, sovereignty and prosperity of the nation. Local authorities exist in the form of the Territorial Administrative Authorities and Cantonal Governments, and are responsible for municipal services and the general well-being of their electorate to whom they are democratically accountable to.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Absolutism and the Monarchy</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy">
                        <p>Sovereign authority must be <b>unlimited</b> and <b>perpetual</b>. This authority must therefore be exercised by persons who have the best interests of the nation at heart, such that their self-interests are effectively that of the nation's. But there can only be one - competing power structures and multiple persons of equal authority lead to sectarianism, factionalisation, cultism, and then chaos and civil wars.</p>
                        <p>All men are self-interested; they act in their own self-interests. When a monarch has sovereign authority, his only self-interest must be in the preservation of such authority. The fair monarch will therefore only use such authority in a respectable manner in order to preserve it, thus prioritising the national interest over his own - the wise monarch will naturally learn to align his interests with that of the nation.</p>
                        <p>A parliamentary democracy, or any democracy, concerns itself with the practical art of governance based on historical experience. This is contrary to rationalist thinking that is based on abstract notions of ideology and the creation or destruction of order. In Imperial Royal Union the central government is guided by rationalism in perfecting the state of order while local authorities attempt to balance the needs and desires of the people.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Extrajudiciality and the Rule of Law</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy">
                        <p>The rule of law is critical to the survival of every civilisation. But the rule of law originates from the monarch as the single source of sovereign authority. Without the monarch, there is no law to base the rule on - the monarch determines the rule of law. In doing so, he is above the law.</p>
                        <p>The wise and fair monarch will recognise the need for good laws during normal circumstances, to which he will also be expected to follow in order for the rule of law to be accepted. But in exceptional circumstances, the monarch must also be able to respond with decisiveness beyond the law - strict adherence to the rule of law during exceptional circumstances will jeopardise the order and stability that has been achieved and maintained by the rule of law during normal circumstances.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Order and Morality</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy">
                        <p>Government is not about morality; it is about order.</p>
                        <p>Good and evil are vague concepts in which the government should not and cannot be concerned with, rather the purpose of government is to ensure that society does not descend in chaos and anarchy. Order and stability are the only ultimate ends that ought to be achieved by government. How the government arrives at order and stability is secondary, although it is important to consider how the execution and implementation of law to maintain order and stability may deliver results that are contrary to the ends.</p>
                        <p>It is inevitable that the people expect some moral guidance from government. The tiered-system allows for local authorities to sacrifice order for morality in its policies in order to appease the people, thus freeing the central government to focus on order and stability.</p>
                        <p>It is more democratic to do some things in secret, and often to protect democracy, one has to resort to undemocratic measures.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept">

                <h3 class="policy_header">Separation of Powers</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy">
                        <p>While the principles behind the separation of powers are well-intended, in reality the separation is practically unequal. At separation, if all branches of government can effectively check one another, then it would be impossible to govern - there will always be one branch with more power than the other. More often than not, it is often the legislature that determines the extent of the powers of the executive and judiciary</p>
                        <p>Integrating this into Imperial Royal Union, each branch of government, when in conflict with another, will turn to the Emperor to reconcile its differences. It is important to recognise that a proper separation prevents the abuse of power by any one branch, but a situation of deadlock is equally undesirable. Introducing the Emperor as the final arbiter also allows the Emperor to serve as the ultimate check against abuse of power.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept">

                </div>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Combining Monarchy and Democracy</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>It is no longer possible for the monarch to govern alone in the modern nationstate. To settle for a lesser form of government that is democracy would be an injustice that jeopardises the potential of the nationstate. The only way is to incorporate the key principles of both systems into government.</p>
                        <p>The permanence and stability in a monarchy exists in the central government and the Emperor's role in maintaining the integrity and sovereignty of the state. The central government is appointed by the Emperor, its only aim is to maintain order and stability and provide leadership in times of crisis. It must have all the power necessary to be able to effectively intervene against any external or internal attempt to destabilise society, but it must not be perceived to be too eager or capable to provide everything for the people, rather it needs to carefully plan and prioritise between needs and desires. The goal is to stabilise, not appease.</p>
                        <p>Local authorities, on the other hand, account for the benefits of a democracy. A democracy allows the people to exercise their civic duty and contribute their ideas at each election. Local authorities thus serve as the main channel of feedback. The reactionary nature of a democracy allows local authorities to respond swiftly to the needs and desires of the people, and with limited resources, they are forced to balance the needs and desires of the people accordingly. Those that fail will be voted out, and those that succeed will be invited to participate in the central government.</p>
                        <p>Combining both systems eliminates the disconnect between the centralised monarch and the people across the nation by ensuring that there are adequate feedback channels in government through democratic institutions. The fear of populism and short-termism is also limited in its area of impact, that a single populist government cannot drag the rest of the nation down with it, and the central government has all the power to intervene and correct the situation.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">The Four Branches of HIM Government</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>There are four branches of HIM Government, or to be more accurate, one overarching branch (the Privy Council) and three subordinate branches.</p>
                        <p>The Privy Council, with the Emperor at the helm, manages the defence and security of the nation as its first priority through the various Privy Council Executive Organisations. The judiciary, the Supreme Court of Judicature, reports directly to the Emperor although it is customary for most matters of justice to be left to the Chief Justices, occasionally consulting with the Emperor on the direction. The remainder of the executive in the Public Service Secretariat report back to the Privy Council and manage the national agencies that provide assistance to the Territorial Administrative Authorities and the Cantonal Governments. Lastly, the legislature, the Estates-General, comprises the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The appointed Senate comprises of senior political figures and experienced civil servants as the deliberative authority directly before the Emperor, and the indrectly-elected Chamber of Deputies serves as a consultative body and aggregates feedback on the ground either directly from the people or indirectly through the Cantonal Governments. When necessary, the Emperor may enact laws by decree, especially during emergency situation.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Centralisation, Federalism, Devolution and Autonomy</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>The business of governance in an absolute monarchy is wide-ranging and never-ending. To cement the sovereign authority of the monarch, there needs to be a central government in which all power is decentralised. Yet at the same time, an element of federalism exists such that the 54 Cantons may exist and operate independent of each other, but not independent from the central government or from their regional authorities that co-operate with them on inter-Canton objectives. Cantonal Governments are devolved authorities - Powers not explicitly granted to the Cantonal Governments are retained by the central government and that the powers granted may be revoked unconditionally. By providing local authorities with such a degree of autonomy, the central government does not need to be responsible for the failures of local authorities and can instead build on improvements in governance based on their successes.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">The Imperialean Social Contract</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy">
                        <p>At each level of government, civil servants are representatives of the State in service of the people and elected officials are representatives of the people and enjoined with powers by the State. The people are subjects of the State. The Emperor is the State and the State is the Emperor. This means that everyone in Imperial Royal Union is accountable to the State and by extension the Emperor - sovereign accountability. Similarly, they are also accountable to each other and the public-at-large - public accountability. It is thus the Emperor's duty to ensure that the dual accountability is upheld and in return the people agree to subject themselves to the Emperor. Such is the social contract of Imperial Royal Union.</p>
