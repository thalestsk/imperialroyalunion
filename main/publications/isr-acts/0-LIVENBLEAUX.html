                <h2 class="edict-heading">Explanatory Notes</h2>
                <p class="edict-preamble">Imperial Edicts ("Edicts") are legal instruments proclaimed by the Emperor and form the basis for the law of the land. Edicts are perpetual for the lifetime of the reigning Emperor and irrevocable - a <i>de facto</i> revocation occurs once a new Edict declaring the contrary intention to a current one is proclaimed.</p>
                <p class="edict-preamble">The very first Edict of Livenbleaux was proclaimed in 2012 at the accession of Emperor Thales XIII to the throne, which effectively ensured the continuity of government by recognising the government of the late Emperor Thales XII as his government (since the Edict establishing the government under Emperor Thales XII automatically expired upon his passing, which meant the then government would legally cease to be the government if not re-established by another Edict).</p>
                <p class="edict-preamble">Under Emperor Thales XIII, the structure of the government underwent 3 major changes in 2014, 2017 and finally in 2019, culminating in the current iteration of His Imperial Majesty's Government. The Edict of Livenbleaux thus superseded the previous Edicts when it was proclaimed.</p>
                <p class="edict-preamble">Historically, the Edicts that establish the governments of the Imperialean monarchs often went through multiple changes in the first decade of their reign, in which they were used to refine the size and structure to the style of governance of the reigning monarch. These Edicts would then survive in its current form for the next few decades, and perhaps with occasional tweaks and balances. The key importance of these Edicts is derived from the declaration of intention by the reigning monarch to rule - 13 out of 18 monarchs used these Edicts to establish absolutist rule, while 5 successive monarchs from (Emperor Thales XI to Emperor Thales XII, inclusive of Empress Rothsanna II) used Edicts to establish constitutional governments with parliamentary systems, while the final authority still rested with them (even though they hardly ever used it, except to proclaim their Edicts).</p>
