                        <li class="paragraph">Where the discrepancy exists on any tax filing in which the total value of tax to be paid exceeds a floating ceiling value set and revised annually by the Administration, or where no substantive correction or tax payment has been made after the third notice issued to the entity, or where the investigating officer is not satisfied with the outcome of the interview, if any, or the outcome of the investigation, the investigating officer shall refer and transfer full authority of the investigation to the Administration, which shall then be responsible for all subsequent enforcement actions.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Where the investigating officer is satisfied with an entity’s tax filings upon serving at least 1 notice and where the necessary and accurate corrections have been made, but where the entity has been investigated for such discrepancies at least 2 other times, the investigating officer shall, under the advisement of a second officer, refer the investigation to the Administration, which shall then be responsible for all subsequent enforcement actions.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">The Administration may enforce against such instances via the imposition of fines as determined by the Comptroller-General of Public Revenue or refer ongoing investigations for prosecution and related criminal proceedings.</li>
