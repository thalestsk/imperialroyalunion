                        <li class="paragraph">The review of powers may be retroactive, depending on the exigency of circumstances prompting the exercise of such powers.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Where the appropriate authority retroactively deems the exercise of such powers as unjustified within the context of the circumstances prompting the exercise of such powers, or where a public security officer has exercised such powers outside of his jurisdictional limits without prior authorisation, the appropriate authority shall refer the public security officer and his findings for further review by an internal committee and an independent authority within the Directorate-General.</li>

                        <li class="paragraph">The use of force shall be reasonable and proportional to the offence being committed.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">The use of force shall be applied only after a verbal warning issued by the public security officer and the display, in part or in full, the warrant of authority.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">The use of force may be used by an officer to effect an arrest.</li>

                        <li class="paragraph">Where lethal force is used, the appropriate authority shall refer the public security officer for further review by an internal committee and an independent authority within the Directorate-General, during which the public security officer shall be suspended from further duties until otherwise noticed by the internal committee through the appropriate authority.</li>
                        <li class="paragraph">Where a review finds the use of lethal force as unjustified by both the internal committee and independent authority, and upon the acceptance of the findings of such review by the Deputy Director-General for Administration, the public security officer shall bear no immunity and civil liability claims and criminal prosecution.</li>
