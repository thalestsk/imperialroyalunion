            <h1>COVID-19 Pandemic Response</h1>
            <p>When news of a novel Coronavirus outbreak surfaced in early December 2019, the privy council held multiple discussions to determine Imperial Royal Union's approach. Swift precautionary measures were deployed quickly and a strict quarantine regime was instituted. As the global situation developed, it became clear that crisis had impacted Imperial Royal Union indirectly - not by direct, uncontrolled transmission within Imperial Royal Union, but by the economic fallout from mishandling of the pandemic by other nations in which Imperial Royal Union maintained economic ties.</p>

            <p>While the national COVID-19 pandemic response is determined by HIM Government, the local Cantonal Governments may take further actions to enhance or tighten response measures as they deem necessary.</p>

            <p>HIM Government issued a nationwide lockdown for 3 months starting from 1 June 2020 to 30 August 2020, with heightened restrictions until 31 December 2020. Instead of sporadic lockdowns and phased re-opening to protect short-term economic interests, HIM Government opted for a prolonged lockdown and tightened measures before a full re-opening. One factor for such a posture was the global economy, in which a phased re-opening of the national economy would not return to desirable levels given the uncertain global outlook. The prolonged shutdown and quick re-opening of the domestic economy in a whole, considering the economic benefits paid out, loss in revenue and other costs, when compared to the costs of a gradual re-opening with the phasing out of restrictions, such as the burden on the healthcare system and prolonged benefits paid out, was significantly lower.</p>

            <p>Under the strict quarantine regime, Imperial Royal Union has successfully eradicated all community spread, and all infectious persons since 27 March 2021 have been identified when in quarantine.</p>

            <h2>Public Health Measures</h2><hr>
            <p>Public health experts across the world have determined that COVID-19 spreads by droplets. However, given the humidity in certain parts of Imperial Royal Union, and the overall risk-based posture adopted by HIM Government, the Public Health Office decided to take the precautionary stance that the virus could be potentially airborne.</p>

            <h3>Face Masks</h3>
            <p>The wearing of masks in public was made mandatory since 1 February 2020. Face coverings, face shields, scarves and other apparel may not be substituted for masks. As of 1 May 2021, following the success of border measures, the wearing of face masks are no longer mandatory, but remain recommended for other public health reasons.</p>

            <h3>Work From Home</h3>
            <p>Working from home was first recommended in early May 2020, and made mandatory by all Cantonal Governments and in Port Imperial Capital Territory by July 2020, except for staff where their occupations require their physical presence. While this is no longer mandatory as of 1 October 2020, 52 out of 55 Cantonal Governments and the Port Imperial Capital Territory have put in force legislation to ensure that 50% of staff continue to be scheduled to work from home if possible, recognising the benefits of such flexibility.</p>

            <br><h2>Border Measures</h2><hr>
            <p>Border measures were recommended by the Public Health Office and enforced by the Border Protection Department of the Directorate-General of Public Security. As of the current global situation, HIM Government will not consider travel bubble agreements due to the absence of a strong guarantee against a potential uncontrolled outbreak in other nations.</p>

            <h3>PCR test and ART</h3>
            <p>All travellers entering into Imperial Royal Union must test negative on a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test and Antigen Rapid Test (ART) no more than 72 hours and 2 hours prior to departure respectively. Passenger carriers by air, land and sea must enforce such checks or face fines or operating bans.</p>

            <h3>Quarantine</h3>
            <p>Upon arrival in Imperial Royal Union, a 21-day quarantine will be imposed, where travellers must bear 75% of all costs associated with quarantine. Upgrades in accommodation, food and drink, and other services shall be borne entirely by travellers. Travellers will be subject to PCR tests on the 1st, 14th and 20th day of their quarantine.</p>

            <br><h2>Vaccination</h2><hr>
            <p>While HIM Government advocates for vaccination, vaccination has not been rolled out yet. Upon finalisation of the vaccination programme and acquisition of sufficient supplies, universal walk-in vaccination for everyone in Imperial Royal Union (including foreigners) is expected to commence in August 2021. Students in primary and secondary education institutions will receive their vaccinations as part of the existing Schools Immunisation Programme. Vaccination will be made mandatory, and in due time travellers must be vaccinated prior to arrival in Imperial Royal Union.</p>

            <p>Due to vaccine efficacy, HIM Government continues to view preventive measures at the borders to be more effective than full vaccination, thus avoiding the need for hasty implementation of the vaccination programme.</p>

            <h3>Vaccine Approval</h3>
            <p>HIM Government takes a very stringent approach in the scrutiny of vaccines prior to approval. The 2 most important critieria are vaccine efficacy and safety. When evaluating the efficacy of a vaccine, the National Quarantine & Vaccination Agency will take into consideration the genetic composition, size and environmental conditions of the sample pool during clinical trials as well as the live data from other nations who have rolled out the vaccine. In general, vaccines with a less than 90% audited efficacy will not be accepted.</p>

            <h3>Vaccine Acquisition</h3>
            <p>The National Quarantine & Vaccination Agency has approved the use of 2 vaccines within Imperial Royal Union, the locally-developed Vaximus by the Genomic Research & Serum Institute, and a modified Sputnik-V from Gamaleya Institute (Russia), produced locally under-licence by Serafim Therapeutics. As of 1 June 2021, Imperial Royal Union has secured enough doses to vaccinate half of Imperial Royal Union, and is on track to acquiring sufficient doses to vaccinate the entire population by the end of the 2021.</p>
