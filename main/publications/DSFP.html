                        <p>War is an extension of politics when diplomacy fails to achieve its objectives. While Imperial Royal Union will not default to war as the go-to option when diplomacy is unable to achieve the desired outcome, a surgical, pre-emptive first strike will not be ruled out. Especially in the face of stateless terrorists and other non-state actors, diplomacy is not necessarily an option. Any outcome of diplomacy conducted with hostile or belligerent entities must be to achieve détente, short of appeasement. When faced with military threats by state actors in the form of coercion through a display of military assets, Imperial Royal Union will respond in kind. At the outbreak of war, the goal is to secure a quick and decisive victory, but when the odds are not favourable, to inflict irreparable damage to the physical assets and spirit of the enemy.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Universal Conscription</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Main Article: <a href="LINK">National Service</a></p>
                        <p>Universal conscription is necessary to ensure there is an adequate reserve force and to provide opportunities for youths to have a career in the uniformed services. National Service does not discriminate against gender but physical strength and ability. This means that every physically fit male or female will be enlisted - everyone has a part to play in the defence of the nation.</p>
                        <p>Upon the completion of pre-tertiary studies or upon reaching the age of 20, whichever is earlier, all citizens, male and female, have to register for a medical examination at approved healthcare institutions, after which they will receive their National Service Status (NSS) which determines if they are to be enlisted.</p>
                        <p>All citizens are enlisted for a minimum period of 6 months with options to extend. After their discharge from service, they receive benefits under the National Service Discharge Scheme. They are also recalled as part of the active reserve for annual training and refresher courses.</p>
                        <p>National Service is designed to be as short as possible but with the flexibility to extend service. This allows a sizeable reserve force to be built up to deter against an invasion of Imperial Royal Union. The options for extensions allows those with a stronger sense of duty and leadership to have a more fulfilling experience in the military, and allows them to transition into a career in the military. The NSDS provides benefits to those who have served, in recognition for them sacrificing time in their lives to contribute to the defence of the nation.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 levels of National Service Status (NSS) that determines if a citizen is to be enlisted:</p>
                        <div class="orgtree">
                            <ul>
                                <li>NSS-1: Mandatory enlistment for combat vocations</li>
                                <li>NSS-2: Mandatory enlistment for support or combat vocations</li>
                                <li>NSS-3: Optional enlistment for support vocations</li>
                                <li>NSS-4: Mandatory rejection from service</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Citizens classified under NSS-1 and NSS-2 will be enlisted within 3 months upon notice of their NSS being served. Citizens under NSS-3 have a 1-month period to accept or reject enlistment, and those that accept will be enlisted in the same 3-month window as those under mandatory enlistment. Citizens under NSS-2 or NSS-3 may be posted (at the discretion of the National Service Office in the National Defence Administration) to serve in the Directorate-General of Public Security as public security officers.</p>
                        <p>The enlistment period stands at a minimum of 6 months, during which enlistees will be paid 30% of the wage of a full-time career soldier. Enlistees will be evaluated by the end of the 5th month - enlistees with unsatisfactory performance will be automatically discharged after the 6-month period without the benefits from the National Service Discharge Scheme (NSDS). Enlistees with satisfactory performance may extend their service for another 6 months. Those that do not extend will receive the Basic Package of NSDS while those that extend will receive the Enhanced Package of the NSDS. Enlistees that opt to take up officer and specialist roles are automatically extended for 9 months for their enhanced training. At discharge, they will receive the Officer's Package or the Specialist's Package of the NSDS respectively.</p>
                        <p>Upon discharge from service, former enlistees form part of the active reserve together with former career soldiers. The active reserve is called up for a period of 1-2 weeks every year for re-training and refresher courses. A former serviceman or servicewoman is discharged from the active reserve and into the inactive reserve upon completion of 12 call-up cycles with a cumulative total of 120 days of re-training.</p>
                        <p>National Service is designed to be as short as possible with options for extensions. This allows a sizeable reserve force to be built up to deter against an invasion of Imperial Royal Union. The options for extensions allows those with a stronger sense of duty and leadership to have a more fulfilling experience in the military, and allows them to transition into a career in the military. The NSDS provides benefits to those who have served, in recognition for them sacrificing time in their lives to contribute to the defence of the nation.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Beyond Nuclear Deterrence</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>"Mutually assured destruction is so 20th century." If a government's purpose is to preserve order, then the object of war should not only to destroy order, but to prevent order from being preserved or re-established. The point then, is not to annihilate the enemy, but to prolong the suffering of the enemy for as long as possible. Imperial Royal Union's policy of deterrence is not to destroy the world, but the destroy humanity as we know it.</p>
                        <p>Imperial Royal Union has nuclear weapons and will use such weapons as the last-resort and not as the first strike. All nuclear weapons are deployed via multiple independent re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). However, the aim of the nuclear last-resort strike is not to destroy population centres, economic hubs or industrialised areas, but to destroy and contaminate the food and water supply. Farmland, woodland, freshwater systems and coastal areas are the key target. No government can maintain a content populace that does not have an adequate supply of freshwater and food.</p>
                        <p>The full extent of last-resort measures also aim to destabilise infrastructure. Any satellite, civilian or military, allied or enemy, in space would become a target for destruction if not already destroyed as part of the war strategy. Submarines would be instructed to cut undersea fibre optic cables around the world, while laying mines in the vicinity to hinder repair works. All remaining cruise missiles will also be launched to target water-retaining structures such as dams and dykes, bridge supports and tunnel portals of highways and railways, oil and gas pipelines and storage reserves, mines and quarries, ships in port and port facilities, and power plants and tranmission stations.</p>
                        <p>Cities will be left standing before descending into complete anarchy from the total loss of services and upon depletion of the national stockpile of food and water.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Antarctic Research, Exploration and Survey</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Imperial Royal Union's Antarctic programme is known as ARES - "Antarctic Research, Exploration & Survey". ARES is a foreign policy objective as well as a matter of national sovereignty, that Imperial Royal Union should have unfettered access into the Antarctic to meet its fishing and energy needs. While the current position is that the Antarctic is not to be militarised, military vessels patrol the area to ensure that Imperialean objectives can be met uneventfully.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Cooperation, Collaboration and Collusion</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>International cooperation to achieve national interests is essential to Imperial Royal Union's foreign policy. For as long as Imperialean interests are not threatened, then cooperation will always remain an option. Beyond cooperation, collaboration is possible in bringing greater ties and mutual benefits. This extends to key partners that have the foresight and vision to work together on transnational issues to further the long-term goals of both nations. When the net effect on the national interest is positive, collusion can also be an option for bilateral ties. Imperialean diplomacy is reciprocal in principle - ask no questions on what we do and in return Imperial Royal Union can close all eyes as well; do our dirty work for us and we will do yours for you.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Foreign Policy Instruments and Crisis Response</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>The "carrot-and-stick" approach is generally not the style of foreign policy pursued by Imperial Royal Union. This stems from the belief that Imperial Royal Union is abound with opportunities and areas of shared interests, and thus the need to encourage other state actors to gravitate towards the Imperialean sphere of influence is not necessarily the most effective strategy. Rather, the primary focus in on deterring other nations from attempting to incur into the Imperialean sphere of influence. This comes in the form of sanctions, embargoes, and generally almost every avenue that can be made possible by the sheer scale of the Imperialean economy and sovereign wealth.</p>
                        <p>Unless a crisis has a net negative effect on global Imperialean interests, Imperial Royal Union is obligated to act in support as a mediator short of providing actual aid. On learning of an international incident, the position to be taken is that the incident is unlikely to escalate. Should there be an escalation into a crisis, it should be stressed that no Imperialean intervention would be necessary. When intervention becomes a necessity, it should be recognised that the situation had deteriorated to a point where Imperialean intervention would not achieve anything. Once the crisis has past, it is always easy to say in retrospect that Imperialean intervention would have made a difference, but given the current reality, it is too late for any action to be taken by Imperial Royal Union.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Economic and Cyber Warfare</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Imperial Royal Union accumulates sovereign wealth primarily as an emergency fund to protect the nation against economic shocks. However, sovereign wealth is an equally powerful offensive tool when employed correctly. Every hostile nation that cannot be subdued by military force without disproportionate Imperialean casualties must therefore be weakened by economic or cyber warfare to deter further hostile actions. Economic warfare ranges from stock market instability, counterfeit money and corporate takeovers, usually happening all at once. Cyber warfare is considered an escalation and is primarily targeted at central banks and electronic payment systems (to "encourage" the use of counterfeit money) as well as the majority of communications platforms. However, to prevent an unnecessary escalation to an outright nuclear war, the extent of Imperialean cyber warfare refrains from attacks on missile defence systems and nuclear-related systems, despite the offensive capabilities that have been developed thus far.</p>

                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Policing in Imperial Royal Union is aggregated into the Directorate-General of Public Security. The Directorate-General establishes local police units at the Cantonal level, which are then augmented and supported by police units at the Territorial level for incidents and crime too extensive for the local police units to handle, with national police agencies dealing with national crime. While the policing system and public security policy is generally determined by the Directorate-General, Cantonal Governments and Territorial Administrative Authorities can make use of the system to provide their input on the objectives and principles of how public security can be conducted. Cantonal Governments can go further to implement legislation beyond what is covered under the national Penal Code, as well as provide further support in the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

                        <p>Surveillance either by overt means or covert operations are necessary for the security of the state. The question then, is not if, but how surveillance programmes are to be conducted. By entrusting the National Surveillance Institute as the sole authority on surveillance, the onus then is on the Institute to uphold the guidelines and procedures surrounding surveillance, and it can then be held to account in the event of a breach or violation by any entity authorised by it to conduct surveillance operations.</p>
