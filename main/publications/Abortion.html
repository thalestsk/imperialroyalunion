                        <p>Abortion has been a fiery point of contention between pro-life and pro-choice camps in many other nations. Both camps arise out of the belief that no one has the right to take a life and that every woman should have the right to make a choice as to whether to give birth or not respectively. The determination and enforcement of the abortion policy has been devolved to the Cantonal Governments, and the general position of HIM Government is that any stance taken by the Cantonal Governments must be responsible and properly followed-through. Most of the Cantonal Governments have aligned their policies to 3 general approaches.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Individual choices not part of societal responsibility</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>Universally adopted by the Cantons of the Territories of Islandus and Imperialia, there are no restrictions to abortion. However, the Cantonal Governments will no subsidise any form of treatment relating to or leading to abortion, and public hospitals performing such treatment procedures are entitled to charge fees equivalent to that of private hospitals for such treatment procedures, regardless of whether the pregnancy was a result of consensual or non-consensual intimacy.</p>
                        <p>Permanent procedures such as sterilization are generally not covered by subsidies, but the exact details differ between the Cantons.</p>
                        <p>Abortion may only be subsidised in the event of a life-threatening emergency as part of emergency treatment procedures, the priority is to save the person with the ability to contribute to the economy, and not the future person with the potential to contribute to the economy.</p>
                        <p>Little to no childcare subsidies exist as part of this approach. In the Cantons of Sydonis, Cambescent, San Porto and Santa Eliza, daycare and babysitting services cater to only the upper-middle class and above due to the affordability of such services, without much assurance of actual quality.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Abortion as the last resort</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>All the Cantons in the Southern Isles Territory and Eastern Territory with the exception of East Triesenberg and West Triesenberg adopt this stance where abortion is limited only to severe cases. Central to this approach is proper family planning. The Cantonal Governments provide high subsidies for the use of contraceptive and contraception procedures to discourage residents from having unwanted children.</p>
                        <p>Only in life-threatening situations and pregnancies arising from non-consensual intimacy is abortion allowed. However, public orphanages have been strengthened with greater funding to accept unwanted children without having to lead to abortion.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Triesenberg Protocol</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>The Triesenberg Protocol is a legally binding agreement entered into when Triesenberg was split to form the Cantons of East Triesenberg and West Triesenberg that ensured that the legislation of Triesenberg was imported wholesale into the 2 Cantons except for those laws that were incompatible with national laws. One set of such laws were the laws pertaining to abortion, which had been outlawed since 1920 as a result of declining birth rates and rising emigration rates. The abortion laws were further strengthened during the split under the Protocol, and as a result is easily perceived as radical or draconian to the rest of the nation.</p>
                        <p>Under the Triesenberg Protocol, abortion is outlawed but may be allowed under a very specific and narrow condition - a life-threatening emergency to the mother where the fetus was already dead or if all doctors present in the operating theatre or trauma room are of the opinion that the fetus would not be able to survive if left within the womb. The sale of contraceptives and the performance permanent contraception procedures are also banned, although such a ban is often circumvented by crossing into other Cantons.</p>
                        <p>One point of ambiguity which is often challenged is the concept of "all doctors present", since different hospitals may have different doctors assigned to a single patient, and also includes the doctors that are not specialised in gynaecology or pediatrics. The definition has been contested up to the Eastern Territory Circuit Court, which has upheld the Cantonal Governments' view that the ambiguity was purposefully written as such to allow the Cantonal Governments the flexibility to define it as they wish.</p>
                        <p>The Triesenberg Protocol is enforced by means of childbirth records. Each and every pregnant woman is registered upon discovery of pregnancy and can be fined up to IRE 50,000 if they are unable to provide proof of childbirth or a doctor's memo indicating otherwise at the end of 10 months (to factor in for late childbirths). This means that those that seek abortion treatment in other Cantons where it may be permitted will still face prosecution even if they decide not to return, given the shared policing and judicial systems between the Cantons.</p>
                        <p>Despite the various restrictions, both East Triesenberg and West Triesenberg boast the highest levels of funding and quality for childcare. Maternity leave is also generous, with a mandatory 6 months given to all mothers, and shared leave between both parents of an additional 3 months. Every year, both parents are each entitled to 3 weeks of parental leave for each child (applicable only to children conceived in either Canton), up to a maximum of 2 months, and may trade away each week of parental leave for increased childcare subsidies such as for daycare placements or babysitters.</p>

                <h3 class="policy_header">Role of HIM Government</h3>
                <div class="policy_box">
                    <div class="policy full">
                        <p>HIM Government has clarified that it has no interest for now in mandating a national abortion policy, especially since it is dependent on the local socio-economic situation in each Canton. While there may be a lack of support for the hardline measures under the Triesenberg Protocol within HIM Government, there is no pertinent need to reform the Triesenberg Protocol considering the level of support guaranteed for families and that the general populace in the Cantons have generally broad support for the positions adopted by their respective Cantons. Furthermore, legislation in each Canton sufficiently encompasses the whole scope of the policy, adequately covering principles, safeguards, support measures and exceptional cases.</p>
