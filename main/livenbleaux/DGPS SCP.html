            <h2>About Us</h2><hr>
            <p>The Correctional Reform Service is split into 1 main departments and 5 separate prison systems. Under such a system, each Territory operates its own prison system, which can then be tailored to the rehabilitative posture of each Canton within the Territory. Transport of prisoners and offenders awaiting trial depends on the arrangement between the investigative authorities, the courts and the prison systems.</p>
