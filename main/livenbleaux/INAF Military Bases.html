            <p>The Imperialean National Armed Forces and the National Defence Administration categorise all designated area of military use as "military installations" and may consist one or more sites that are geographically-non-contiguous.

            <h2>Military Administrative Units</h2><hr>
            <p>The major military installations are divided into 3 military administrative units - (1) Military Settlements; (2) Defence Establishments; and (3) Regional Cantonments.</p>
            <h3>Military Settlements</h3>
            <p>A Military Settlement is the largest type of military installations able to accommodate up to 1,000,000 personnel and have a permanent civilian population residing within that helps to sustain the commercial activities within the installation. A Military Settlement is managed by a Military Governor.</p>
            <h3>Defence Establishment</h3>
            <p>A Defence Establishment is a satellite military installation of a Military Settlement. It can accommodate up to 200,000 personnel and also has a permanent civilian population residing within, albeit smaller. It is managed by a Military Magistrate subordinate to the Military Governor of its parent Military Settlement.</p>
            <h3>Regional Cantonment</h3>
            <p>A Regional Cantonment is the principal point of military activity in a Canton and serves as the recruitment and basic training centrew within its Canton. Each Regional Cantonment oversees the network of satellite military installations within the same Canton, with the exception of those installations that have been amalgamated or absorbed into Miltiary Settlements or Defence Establishments. A Regional Cantonment is managed by a Military Prefect.</p>
