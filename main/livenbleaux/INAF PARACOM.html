                    <p>The Chief of Paramilitary Forces ("CPF") is 1 of the 4 senior military officers of a 4-star rank, second only to the Chief of Combined Armed Forces ("CCAF"). The CPF is nominated by the CCAF, who is subsequently confirmed at the discretion of the Emperor. Prior to the merger of the miltiary provost forces and the civilian paramilitary forces, the CPF was known as the Chief of Gendarmerie. Today, the term "Gendarmerie" has no relation to the nation's paramilitary forces.</p><br>
