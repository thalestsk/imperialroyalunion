            <h2>Supervisory Authorities</h2><hr>
            <p>There are a total of 5 Supervisory Authorities, comprising the HIM Special Branch, the National Audits Bureau, the Public Supervision Censorate, the Civil Service Procuratorate, and the Corrupt Practices Inspectorate.</p>

                    <p>The HIM Special Branch is the agency responsible for protecting the Emperor and his closest confidantes and family members. It is also responsible for ensuring discipline within the highest ranks of government and removing political dissidents from within the government leadership. Where the Household Guards form part of the military arm of the Emperor's personal enforcers, the HIM Special Branch forms the paramilitary arm. The HIM Special Branch is also responsible for extraordinary supervisory and investigatory action against the departments of the Council of Supervision.</p>

                    <p>The Civil Service Procuratorate is responsible for the investigations into civil servants employed under the Public Secretariat upon receiving complaints or reports from the public or the Public Supervision Censorate. Investigations are centred around breaches and violations of ethical standards and professional responsibilities, as well as abuse of office and misconduct. While the Civil Service Procuratorate only has the authority to suspend or dismiss civil servants, follow-up action may be taken by the Directorate-General of Public Security for criminal offences or by the HIM Special Branch for sensitive issues. Where the uniformed services are unable to conduct internal investigations against senior officers in the leadership due to statutory limits, the Civil Service Procuratorate takes over.</p>

                    <p>The Corrupt Practices Inspectorate is responsible for the investigation into corrupt practices across the public sphere, from within the government to bodies corporate owned by public shareholders or private individuals. Before investigations are opened, complaints, anonymous tip-offs and red-flagged reports from the National Audits Bureau are assessed for actionable grounds before further action is pursued. The Corrupt Practices Inspectorate acts as the independent police force against corruption. In the fight against corruption, the Corrupt Practices Inspectorate has firmly taken enforcement action against the smallest of bribes, and will continue to do so without prejudice.</p>
