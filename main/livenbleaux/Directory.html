            <h2>About the Directory</h2><hr>
            <p>The Directory of Government Agencies is a one-stop e-service for accessing information on all HIM Government affiliated and subordinate departments. Departments are distributed between the different Groups of the Public Service Secretariat for stronger coordination on the implementation of policy. Within each Group, departments may be Commissions, which are technocratic institutions that formulate, research, consult and advise on policy matters, Statutory Departments, which are governed by and derive their executive functions and responsibilities by Acts of Estates, and Affiliated Public Bodies, which are flexible organisations providing services to, within and outside of HIM Government, and may be profit-oriented, even when they receive funding from HIM Government, drawing from both private sector expertise and public service commitment. Each Group is internally managed and coordinated within their own Cabinet Office (which is a misnomer since the Cabinet Offices are specific to each Group and are not a collective body with the highest executive authority).</p>

            <p><br>As the lower house of the Estates-General, the Chamber of Deputies is a consultative forum elected by the citizens in the Cantons of Imperial Royal Union. Each Canton returns 11 Deputies, bringing the total number of Deputies to 539. The electoral system for electing Deputies is dependent on the electoral laws of the Territory which the Cantons are located in. The Chamber is chaired by the Chief Presiding Officer, who is appointed by the Emperor, and may from time to time invite non-Deputies to advise the Chamber on certain matters.</p>
            <p>The powers of the Chamber were expanded under Cap. 2 Estates General Act, allowing the Chamber to originate (but not pass) legislation, arrange and conduct Sessions of Inquiry, suspend the powers of the Cantonal Governments, review and revoke laws passed by Cantonal legislatures, and interpet, review and amend the constitutional laws of the Imperial Royal Union Overseas Territories.</p>
            <p>While Deputies may be elected or appointed, currently all 605 Deputies from the 55 Cantons are elected, through a myriad of varying electoral methods. Deputorial Elections were last conducted nationally on 18 June 2021.</p>
