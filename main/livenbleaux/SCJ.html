            <h1>Supreme Court of Judicature</h1>
            <p>The Supreme Court of Judicature exercises judicial authority on behalf of the Emperor. The judicial system uses a multiple-tier court system that commensurates with the structure of the Imperial Royal Unionâ€™s administrative divisions. Imperial Royal Union is a common law jurisdiction, in which case law forms the primary backbone of the judicial system, supplemented by statutory law. The courts are also granted the right to hear cases on equity. There are no distinctions between criminal justices and civil registrars, all qualified justices may hear cases within their jurisdiction. Legal precedents of higher-tier courts are binding on lower courts and courts of the same level; legal precedents from other common law jurisdictions (these jurisdictions must also recognise the judicial supremacy of their respective monarch) may be inferred within the courts, although it is non-binding on the courts. Juries are not a part of the judicial system.</p>

            <h2>Structure of the Courts</h2><hr>
            <p>Historically, the only court to exist was the Supreme Court of Judicature, until it was decided in the 1600s to create the Subordinate Courts as original and appeal courts beneath the Supreme Court to relieve its caseload. The Subordinate Courts today consists of the Circuit Courts, District Courts and Magistrates Courts, while the Supreme Court consists of the Justiciary Committee, the Court of Three Cassations and the High Court of Justice.</p><br>

            <h3>Justiciary Committee</h3>
            <p>The Justiciary Committee comprises the 7 Chief Justices and is a committee directly under the Privy Council. It has the authority to conduct judicial reviews and hear appeals or judicial petitions in which its rulings are final and binding on all other courts in Imperial Royal Union unless overturned by the Emperor himself. The Justiciary Committee is the only court with the power to intercept appeals (at its dicretion) from the High Court of Justice, thus bypassing the Court of Three Cassations. Anually, the Justiciary Committee accepts less than 0.1% of all appeals from the Court of Three Cassations. As with the Court of Three Cassations, hearings may be both adverserial and inquisitorial, depending on the preference of the presiding justices.</p>

            <h3>Court of Three Cassations</h3>
            <p>The Court of Three Cassations is the appellate court for the High Court of Justice. It comprises of the Justices of Appeals who preside in Three Colleges of Cassation. Historically the Three Colleges each covered a different area of law, although over time their functions have began to converge. Instead of merging the Three Colleges, each College now acts as a review body for the other 2 Colleges. Appeals are first made to the Court and a College is assigned at random, of which 3 Justices of Appeals from that College would preside over the appeal. The assigned College determines the temporary ruling until confirmed by the other 2 Colleges. In an unanimous decision (3-0), at least 1 other College (3 Justices of Appeals) must reach the same ruling by review of court records and testimonies regardless of a split or unanimous decision for the preliminary ruling to be permanent. In a split decision (2-1), the 2 other colleges (3 Justices of Appeals each) must not reach a contrarian view in order for the temporary ruling to be permanent. Since the establishment of this system, the overturning rate of temporary rulings is about 0.5% of the approximately 11,000 appeals accepted annually by the Court. As with the Justiciary Committee, hearings may be both adverserial and inquisitorial, depending on the preference of the presiding justices.</p>

            <h3>High Court of Justice</h3>
            <p>The High Court of Justice is a court of original jurisdiction for civil and criminal cases beyond the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Courts and a court of appellate jurisdiction for cases from the Circuit Courts. Hearings in the High Court are presided over by a Justice of the High Court and are of an adverserial nature. The High Court also serves as the court of original jurisdiction for maritime, immigration and international law.</p>

            <h3>Circuit Courts</h3>
            <p>Circuit Courts are courts tied to each Territory of Imperial Royal Union, and thus only exercise jurisdiction for cases falling within their Territory. The decision of a Circuit Court is therefore not binding on another Circuit Court of another Territory, as legal principles or laws may differ between Territories, but are binding on its subordinated District Courts. Circuit Courts are presided over by Justices of the Territory, and are final instance courts for appeals of cases originating in the Magistrates Courts.</p>

            <h3>District Courts</h3>
            <p>District Courts are courts tied to each Canton of Imperial Royal Union, and thus only exercise jurisdiction for cases falling within their Canton. The decision of a District Court is therefore not binding on another District Court of another Canton, as legal principles or laws may differ between Cantons, but are binding on its subordinated Magistrates Courts. The District Courts, presided over by District Judges, and the courts above it have the power to issue warrants and mete out heavier sentences on criminal cases. Appeals of cases from the Magistrates Courts are re-trialed.</p>

            <h3>Magistrates Courts</h3>
            <p>Magistrates Courts are courts subordinated to the District Courts of its parent Cantons, are courts of first instance and primarily serve as a summons courts for summary offences, marriage courts and coroner's courts. Magistrates Courts, presided over by District Magistrates, have limited sentencing power, and therefore have no authority to issue warrants, and may only imprison offenders when fines and dues cannot be paid.</p>

            <h2>Procedures</h2><hr>
            <p>All court hearings are scheduled at least 3 months in advance, with the exception fo emergency sessions. Emergency sessions may be declared by courts at and above the District Courts level for the purpose of quashing rulings inconsistent with that of the higher courts or in consideration of the public interest and the interests of the Crown that the hearings should be expedited. There has been precedent in which notice for an emergency session was only given 1 week in advance.</p><br>
