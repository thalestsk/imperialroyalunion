            <h1>Public Service Secretariat</h1>
            <p>The Public Service Secretariat is responsible for the administration of the civil service. It is the employer of all public servants on behalf of HIM Government. As part of the executive branch of government, subordinate departments under the direct purview of the Secretariat are referred to as "Statutory Departments" since such departments operate by statute and only receive executive instructions from the leadership of HIM Government occasionally. The importance of the Secretariat is reflected in the Privy Council of Livenbleaux, where the Secretariat is headed by the Lord High Consul with the assistance of the Chief Permanent Secretary and the Coordinating Permanent Secretaries.</p>

            <p><br>As the upper house of the Estates-General, the Senate has the authority to originate and pass legislation on statutory law in Imperial Royal Union. It is chaired by the President of the Senate, who is in turn assisted by the First Vice-President and Second Vice-President of the Senate. Senators are appointed by the Emperor at his discretion and hold the appointment upon revocation by the Emperor or upon resignation. The Senate meets in the Hall of Infinity within the Grande Palais.</p>
            <p>There are currently 35 Senators in the Senate.</p>

            <p><br>As the lower house of the Estates-General, the Chamber of Deputies is a consultative forum elected by the citizens in the Cantons of Imperial Royal Union. Each Canton returns 11 Deputies, bringing the total number of Deputies to 539. The electoral system for electing Deputies is dependent on the electoral laws of the Territory which the Cantons are located in. The Chamber is chaired by the Chief Presiding Officer, who is appointed by the Emperor, and may from time to time invite non-Deputies to advise the Chamber on certain matters.</p>
            <p>The powers of the Chamber were expanded under Cap. 2 Estates General Act, allowing the Chamber to originate (but not pass) legislation, arrange and conduct Sessions of Inquiry, suspend the powers of the Cantonal Governments, review and revoke laws passed by Cantonal legislatures, and interpet, review and amend the constitutional laws of the Imperial Royal Union Overseas Territories.</p>
            <p>While Deputies may be elected or appointed, currently all 605 Deputies from the 55 Cantons are elected, through a myriad of varying electoral methods. Deputorial Elections were last conducted nationally on 18 June 2021.</p>
