            <h2>The Council of Supervision</h2>
            
            <p>The Council of Supervision is a Standing Council of HIM Government that reports directly to the Emperor through the Privy Council of Livenbleaux. The Council is responsible for upholding and enforcing professional standards, accountability and transparency within HIM Government. The Council is headed by the Lord Grand Provost, who concurrently serves as the Director of HIM Special Branch, a subordinate department of the Council of Supervision. Other than the HIM Special Branch, there are two departments for supervisory oversight - the National Audits Bureau and the Public Supervision Censorate - and two departments for investigations and enforcement action - the Civil Service Procuratorate and the Corrupt Practices Inspectorate.</p>
            
            <br/>
            
            <h3>The HIM Special Branch</h3>
            
            <p>The HIM Special Branch is the agency responsible for protecting the Emperor and his closest confidantes and family members. It is also responsible for ensuring discipline within the highest ranks of government and removing political dissidents from within the government leadership. Where the Household Guards form part of the military arm of the Emperor's personal enforcers, the HIM Special Branch forms the paramilitary arm. The HIM Special Branch is also responsible for extraordinary supervisory and investigatory action against the departments of the Council of Supervision.</p>
            
            <ul id="GMIO_List">
                <li><b>Director</b><br/>HH Martin Lohmus</li>
                <li><b>Chief of Protection</b><br/>Mr. Nicholas Lund</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br/>
            
            <h3>The National Audits Bureau</h3>
            
            <p>The National Audits Bureau is responsible for auditing the financial reports of every single government department and re-assessing audits from corporate entities under government ownership. From time to time, the National Audits Bureau also provides ad-hoc auditing services to private entities upon request while unscheduled audits may also be done on private entities. Auditing guidelines are also set by the National Audits Bureau.</p>
            
            <ul id="GMIO_List">
                <li><b>Auditor-General</b><br/>Ms. Alethea Brown</li>
                <li><b>Deputy Auditor-General</b><br/>Mr. Jonah Denrow</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br/>
            
            <h3>The Public Supervision Censorate</h3>
            
            <p>The Public Supervision Censorate is responsible for ensuring discipline within the lower ranks of the government, managing the public image, discipline and conduct of the civil servants employed under the Public Service Secretariat. The Public Service Censorate appoints Censors to government departments to monitor operations and communicate directives and circulars on professional responsibilities and ethical standards. The Public Supervision Censorate does not exercise supervision authority on the uniformed services. The presence of the Public Supervision Censorate is critical in ensuring that the lower ranks of the government will be willing to engage in the reporting of unprofessional conduct and malpractices.</p>
            
            <ul id="GMIO_List">
                <li><b>Censor-General</b><br/>Mr. Gabriel Brunsen</li>
                <li><b>Assistant Censor-General, Islandus</b><br/>Mr. Adrian Schiappa</li>
                <li><b>Assistant Censor-General, Imperialia</b><br/>Ms. Jesseca Tyne</li>
                <li><b>Assistant Censor-General, Eastern Territory</b><br/>Mr. Martin Friar</li>
                <li><b>Assistant Censor-General, Southern Isles</b><br/>Mr. Wilbert Fraser</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br/>
            
            <h3>The Civil Service Procuratorate</h3>
            
            <p>The Civil Service Procuratorate is responsible for the investigations into civil servants employed under the Public Secretariat upon receiving complaints or reports from the public or the Public Supervision Censorate. Investigations are centred around breaches and violations of ethical standards and professional responsibilities, as well as abuse of office and misconduct. While the Civil Service Procuratorate only has the authority to suspend or dismiss civil servants, follow-up action may be taken by the Directorate-General of Public Security for criminal offences or by the HIM Special Branch for sensitive issues. Where the uniformed services are unable to conduct internal investigations against senior officers in the leadership due to statutory limits, the Civil Service Procuratorate takes over.</p>
            
            <ul id="GMIO_List">
                <li><b>Procurator-General</b><br/>Mr. Jon Henrik Kempe</li>
                <li><b>Deputy Procurator-General</b><br/>Ms. Mary Pickett</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br/>
            
            <h3>The Corrupt Practices Inspectorate</h3>
            
            <p>The Corrupt Practices Inspectorate is responsible for the investigation into corrupt practices across the public sphere, from within the government to bodies corporate owned by public shareholders or private individuals. Before investigations are opened, complaints, anonymous tip-offs and red-flagged reports from the National Audits Bureau are assessed for actionable grounds before further action is pursued. The Corrupt Practices Inspectorate acts as the independent police force against corruption. In the fight against corruption, the Corrupt Practices Inspectorate has firmly taken enforcement action against the smallest of bribes, and will continue to do so without prejudice.</p>
