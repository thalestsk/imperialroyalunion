            <h2>Disclaimer</h2><hr>
            <p>Imperial Royal Union is a fictional nation created in the online political simulator NationStates.net. Imperial Royal Union, HIM Government and all affiliated subordinate departments eg. Government Media & Information Office, are purely fictional. Any resemblance or similarity to any factual entity, government organisation or person is purely coincidental and should not be mistaken to be representative of such entities, organisations and persons.</p>

            <p>This site is used for the purposes of storytelling and roleplaying in relation to worldbuilding in the NationStates multiverse with the objective of being fun and experimental, and should not at any point in time be construed as an instrument of ill-will or seditious intent because the author(s) of the site do not wish to be wrongly prosecuted for no good reason under the Internal Security Act of their home territory. Views, opinions and policies found on the site are not definitive or representative of the views of the author(s).</p>
                
            <p>All related content labelled as "news" or "current affairs" within the site are to be treated as fiction and are not to be taken seriously.</p>
                
            <p>All addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and related contact information do not exist. The user is strongly advised against calling the numbers or sending emails to the email addresses and mail to the addresses as the user may incur absolutely unnecessary, if not ridiculous charges through the user's telco or Internet broadband service operator or local postal service. The user may, however, attempt to visit the addresses via Google Maps because the author(s) of the site are equally curious about the search results that may be generated.</p>

            <p>This site has not been designed nor tested for and on mobile devices. Please consider accessing the site through a desktop computer or laptop computer with a decent screen size should the site not display as intended.</p>
