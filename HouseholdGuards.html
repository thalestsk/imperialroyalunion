            <h2>The Royal Household Guards</h2>
            
            <p>The Household Guards are the personal troops of the Emperor of Imperial Royal Union. They distinguished themselves following Emperor Thales VII to the front lines and protected the Emperor while he was directing battle. It was at the Battle of Vaussen Pass that many of the Emperor’s personal troops were massacred by the enemy force while protecting him. The surviving members of the guard slowly formed the Household Guards, who were notably absent during the Coup d’etat of 1840 where they were still fighting at the front. Today, the Household Guards comprise of a few historical regiments of the Emperor, and are still organised in the old army system of 1882. The Household Guards are a separate military force from the Imperialean National Armed Forces, and under the direct command of the Emperor, with the Commander of the Household Guards (concurrently held as Lord High Protector) being appointed by the Emperor. The Household Guards also form the military garrison of Port Imperial.<br/><br/>The Household Guards are divided based on the time in which the unit was established. Each unit has its own ceremonial dress based on its historical uniforms, and only the units of the Middle Guard and Young Guard have a separate modern combat uniform for non-ceremonial duties. The Old Guard can only be seen within the Grande Palais, and is the active ceremonial and combat guard of the Emperor's residence. The Emperor always attends the morning or evening flag raising or lowering parade with the Old Guard. The Middle Guard performs the role of a gendarmerie within Port Imperial as part of the civil guard alongside the police force, with the ceremonial dress as normal duty dress while the modern combat uniforms are worn by the reserve and standby forces during emergencies. The Middle Guard is a primarily mounted guard when seen on normal duty. The Young Guard acts as the primary garrison force in Port Imperial, trained as elite urban combat units rivalling the Army's White Guard and Navy's Svartvakt. It is also equipped with modern combat equipment for special emergencies.</p>

            <h4>History</h4>
            
            <p>Prior to the July Regency, only the 1st and 3rd Regiments were on active duty at the Grande Palais, while the Middle Guard and Young Guard were distributed across the nation for purely ceremonial duties, with a number of regiments having a strength of less than 100 guardsmen. The 18th Regiment Avonne Guards of the Young Guard were raised with the permission of then Emperor Thales XII for then Crown Prince Thales, which numbered at a strength of 120 guardsmen. Following the events of the July Regency, the 18th Regiment was activated and used by newly-crowned Emperor Thales XIII to remove Princess Rothsanna as regent in a historic and unexpected move. Immediately after, the 18th Regiment was reconstituted and elevated to the 2nd Garde de l'Impériale of the Old Guard. Previously, the 2nd Regiment had been reserved for the dedicated guards of the consort of the reigning monarch, which had been disbanded following the death of the Empress-Consort in 1997. Recognising the potential of the Household Guards as a reactionary force within the capital and the symbolic omnipresence exuded by the guards on parade, an immediate recall of all regiments was executed, with the strengths restored.</p>
